This project is a simple Python-based Inventory Management System developed to better reflect simple software engineering and design decisions in a clean, maintainable and scalable manner. Implemented a functional inventory app that fulfills add, update, list and delete item functions in addition to using a modular structure that distributes responsibilities between numerous python modules and folders. The idea is that all the core logic for managing inventory lives within the `InventoryManager` class; item attributes and behavior are defined in their own `Item` class, separating responsibilities cleanly and enabling low coupling. An additional utility module is responsible for validating input parameters, making the main code cleaner, more reliable and keeping with the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle. So by designing the code like this, the project naturally relies on fundamental design principles like modularity, abstraction, encapsulation, and reusability, for a system that is easier to test, debug, extend, and cooperate with. The separation of concerns makes it easy to add features in the future—such as data persistence via JSON or databases, user authentication, or a GUI front-end—without having to fundamentally change the existing code. Using interfaces is a great way to implement abstraction, as they abstract the inner workings of the logic and provide an easy way to access the functionality of the application, without knowing the validation and storage mechanisms, for instance, just using one method to add an item. Encapsulation protects that state by allowing each object (item) to hold its state, compliantly lowering the overall dependencies, and thus increasing reliability. We follow the Single Responsibility Principle, meaning that there is only one job that each module has, which as a result makes the whole system more maintainable and scalable. Moreover, another software design principle known as the Open/Closed Principle is applied here, as the system can be extended with new modules or features without the need for changes to already working components in the code. A whole set of unit tests, located in a separate tests/ directory that validate that all the underlying functionality works as intended and that gives you additional confidence that the whole system is solid and will not break. Besides, it is uploaded to GitHub, maintaining best practices (good comments, strict tree directory, and a good README file). In summary, the README gives a high-level overview of what the project does, and instructions for how to get it running, and examples of how to use it, as well as a guide to the software design principles that we applied so that contributors or users can quickly get up to speed about the project and criteria to follow to expand it. GitHub is best known as the home of open-source software (OSS) projects, but what they lack in stage presence is more than compensated for by the organization and ability to easily keep track of changes over time or allow you to collaborate in the future. In conclusion, this project implements the theories of software design that are taught in textbooks, in a code-oriented environment. It signifies careful consideration of software design, code maintainability, and practical utility, both as a teaching tool and as a framework for more complex system development. Overall, the focus on documentation, modularity, and testing ensures that the system can be reused or extended in other systems with minimal rework, demonstrating the value and necessity of design principles in constructing robust and malleable software.
