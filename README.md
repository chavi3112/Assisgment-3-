The calculator application example above is designed as a hands-on exercise to provide insights about how software design patterns and principles can be mapped against theoretical concepts learned in the abstract with real-world programming practices. By defining a separate function for each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) the script adopts a modular design strategy, which complies with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) whereby each function has a well-defined task. More readable and maintainable code is achieved through this modular design, which also serves as a foundation for scaling the program with complex operations in the future. And it some it reasonably encapsulated and abstract too, as the specific logic for each type of operation is hidden within its function definition, and the user can use a type of operation just by providing the following information without knowing anything about the internal structure of the program. Implementation of very basic Error handling is also done in the script, especially division function where we are checking for a valid division or 0 division, this is one of the main parts of writing stable and user-friendly applications. Nonetheless, an arithmetic error in the division() function, where multiplication is erroneously implemented—emphasizes the importance of testing, debugging, and accurate implementation, showcasing the real-world necessity for quality assurance in software development. From a design pattern perspective, while the script follows a procedural design, the opportunity exists to delve into more complex structures, for instance, by configuring a Strategy Pattern approach in which each arithmetic operation is defined in a class that implements a common interface. Another very useful design pattern that could have been incorporated is the Command Pattern, which would allow a much cleaner and decoupled way to manage the user commands and the operations associated with them that would come in handy if the application were to be expanded with a GUI or additional functionality. From a design perspective, since the script has functions and conditional statements, it alludes to the separation of concerns or separating the logic of computation from user interaction. Such separation is a pillar of well-architected software systems and makes the program more maintainable and easy to debug. Theory and practice converge through code, where theoretical design principles inspire concrete programming techniques. The mixture of book learning and on-the-job experience cements understanding and equips developers to translate that knowhow into practice. In conclusion, even though the calculator script is very simple, it illustrates the case of applying, analyzing, or iterating on principles and patterns of software design for producing functional and maintainable apps.
